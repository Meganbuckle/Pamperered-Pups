          <h2>Where your dog waggles more and barks less!</h2>
          <p>Ever sense i was a kid, dogs have been some of my best friends. I grew up helping my Aunt Maria in her dog grooming salon, The CLip-n-Fluff. It was only naturl that this love for for pets owuld develop into my life's work. After college, In managed a local veternary clinic for six years, until 2003, why my aunt was getting ready to retire and wanted me to take over her busniess. I saw the need for a place where dogs of every breed and size could play and get some TLC while their families were at work or out of town. And so, that year, Pampered Pups was born. We've been pampering dogs ever sence, and they havent stopped wagging their tails!</p>
          <p>Pampered Pups is just as popular with owners as it is with their pets. Our services and hours are tailored to meet the needs of busy pet owners who want their "best friends" treated with affection and care they get at home. Come see for yourself.
